Data Cleaning Mastery: SQL Project for Efficient Data Cleansing.

Skills: Data Cleaning, MySQL,SQL.




## Description:
In this SQL project, I focused on data cleaning techniques. I downloaded a dataset and imported it into an MSSQL Server.

To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and Granular requirements.

This project depened my understanding of data cleaning and its importance in accurate analysis.
## commands used:

DATA CLEANING:
Cleaning the Item_Fat_Content field ensures data consistency and accuracy in analysis. 
 
By using, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and Granular requirements
1.Total Sales:

7.Provide a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of 	Items, Average Rating) broken down by different outlet types.

## Conclusion:
In the end, I gained a lot of experience in SQL. As a Data Analyst, I have to know about data cleaning. In this project, I learned more about data cleaning. Data cleaning is one of the important parts of analysis. By cleaning data at the start, we will save lots of time in the analyses and helps ensure that data is consistent so it can be analyzed accurately.
